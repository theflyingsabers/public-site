    <p>Original TheFlyingSabers was founded here on December 5th, 2018, by Booyahboy. After this shut down, 
      it began its spread across other apps.
    </p>

    <h2>
     Clash of Clans
    </h2>

    <p>
    This is the first place Booyahboy made TheFlyingSabers after SWC shut down. The squad's leadership now lies 
    on the shoulders of Hades, who was also part of the original TFS on SWC.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Marvel Strike Force
    </h2>

    <p>
      Very soon after moving to CoC, TheFlyingSabers also made an appearance on Marvel Strike Force under the leadership
      of GoodBoi.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Boom Beach
    </h2>

    <p>
      Goodboi also created TheFlyingSabers task force on Boom Beach after about six months of halted expansion on 
      Clash of Clans. New members, as well as other TFS members, have joined this group.
    </p>
