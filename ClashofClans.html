<h2>
Clan War Strategy
</h2>
<h5>
  Members of TheFlyingSabers clan on Clash of Clans, feel free to copy and paste the following strategy.
</h5>

<p>
  During every Clan War, the battle day is divided into two phases. The first phase, the Assault Phase,
  lasts from the beginning of the battle day until three hours until the battle day ends. During the Assault
  Phase, all participants are required and expected to use their first
  attack. (Any participants whose war preference is set to "out" are exempted from this rule, unless they
  specifically requested they be included in the war. To those participants who will not be available during
  a war, please comment in the chat beforehand that you will be unavailable.) The attacks in the Assault Phase 
  must be used by a participant of a certain number against a person of the same number on the opposing team. 
  For example, if Booyahboy was number sixteen, then he would be expected to attack number sixteen on the 
  opposing team during the Assault Phase. This rule is always subject to change from war to war, so if you have any 
  questions, please post them in the chat. At the twenty-one hour mark (meaning there are three hours left in the battle day),
  the Cleanup Phase begins. During this three-hour period, everyone is free to use their second attack against any 
 player on the opposing team. Participants are not required to use their second attack, but most are expected to.
 If you have any questions at all about this strategy, please post them in the chat, and Booyahboy and others will
 be happy to answer them.
