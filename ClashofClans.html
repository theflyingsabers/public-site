      This is the first place <span class="username">Booyahboy</span> made
      TheFlyingSabers after
      <span class="no-more">Star Wars Commander</span> shut down. The clan's
      leadership now lies in the hands of <span class="username">Hades</span>,

    <h2>Clan War Strategy</h2>
    <h5>
      Members of TheFlyingSabers clan on Clash of Clans, feel free to copy and
      paste the following strategy.
    </h5>

    <p>
      During every Clan War, the battle day is divided into two phases. The
      first phase, the Assault Phase, lasts from the beginning of the battle day
      until five hours until the battle day ends. During the Assault Phase, all
      participants are required and expected to use their first attack. (Any
      participants whose war preference is set to "out" are exempted from this
      rule, unless they specifically requested they be included in the war. To
      those participants who will not be available during a war, please comment
      in the chat beforehand that you will be unavailable.) The attacks in the
      Assault Phase must be used by a participant of a certain number against a
      person of the same number on the opposing team. For example, if Booyahboy
      was number sixteen, then he would be expected to attack number sixteen on
      the opposing team during the Assault Phase. This rule is always subject to
      change from war to war, so if you have any questions, please post them in
      the chat. At the twenty-one hour mark (meaning there are five hours left
      in the battle day), the Cleanup Phase begins. During this five-hour
      period, everyone is free to use their second attack against any player on
      the opposing team. Participants are not required to use their second
      attack, but most are expected to. If you have any questions at all about
      this strategy, please post them in the chat, and
      <span class="username">Booyahboy</span> and others will be happy to answer
      them.
